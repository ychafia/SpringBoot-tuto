It may take more than one step to fix this issue

Take the step mentioned earlier. Log into your google email account and then go to this link: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and set "Access for less secure apps" to ON. Test to see if your issue is resolved. If it isn't resolved, as it wasn't for me, continue to Step #2.

Go to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6009563 (Titled: "Password incorrect error"). This page says "There are several reasons why you might see a “Password incorrect” error (aka 534-5.7.14) when signing in to Google using third-party apps. In some cases even if you type your password correctly." This page gives 4 suggestions of things to try.

For me, the first suggestion worked:

Go to https://g.co/allowaccess from a different device you have previously used to access your Google account and follow the instructions.
Try signing in again from the blocked app.
There were three more suggestions on the page given in step #2 but I didn't try them because after going to the redacted link and following the instructions, everything began to work as it should.


This worked for me.

1) Login to your gmail account.

2) Go to https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and Turn On this feature.

3) Go to https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and click Continue.

Then you can authenticate your Additional Email Address from your Gmail Account.

Edit: In my case it helped to write smtp.gmail.com instead of smtp.gmail.com:587.
